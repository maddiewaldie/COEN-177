// Description: Creates threads and prints when the threads are iterating / done / returned.
// Instructions: Compile and run the following program, then list how many threads are created and what
// values of i are passed. You may have seen a bug in the program where threads may print the same
// values of i. Why

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>

void *go(void *);
#define NTHREADS 10
pthread_t threads[NTHREADS];

    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < NTHREADS; i++)  
        pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, go, &i);
    for (i = 0; i < NTHREADS; i++) {
    printf("Thread %d returned\n", i);
        pthread_join(threads[i],NULL);
    }
    printf("Main thread done.\n");
    return 0;
}

void *go(void *arg) {
    printf("Hello from thread %d with iteration %d\n",  (int)(unsigned long) pthread_self(), *(int *)arg);
